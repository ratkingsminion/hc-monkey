# hc-monkey
A port of the Hardon Collider library to Monkey-X

Hardon Collider: http://hc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Monkey-X: http://www.monkey-x.com/

This port was meant as learning experience and thus is probably not optimized, and buggy, and full of strange code

Example: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10650964/_stuff/hc-monkey/hc-monkey-example.html

hc-monkey uses mojo2, but this can be changed easily by replacing the drawing methods in shapes.monkey
